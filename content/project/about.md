============

Shifu is an open-source, end-to-end machine learning platform for Hadoop.  Shifu is designed for data scientists, simplifying the life-cycle of building machine learning models. 

While originally built for fraud modeling at <a href="http://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a>, Shifu is generalized for many other modeling domains.

<span class="first-word">Speed</span> - Shifu's fast Hadoop-based, distributed neural network training can reduce model training time from days to hours  

<span class="first-word">Scalability</span> - Train models on huge data sets, even on small Hadoop clusters. Easily train multiple bags in parallel

<span class="first-word">Simplicity</span> - Shifu provides a simple command-line interface for each step of the model building process, including

- [Statistic calculation](/docs/stable/guide/stats) & [variable selection](/docs/stable/guide/varselect) to determine the most predictive variables in your data
- [Variable normalization](/docs/stable/guide/normalize)
- Distributed neural network [model training](/docs/stable/guide/train)
- Post training analysis & [model evaluation](/docs/stable/guide/eval)

Shifu integrates with Pig workflows on Hadoop, and Shifu-trained models can be integrated into production code with a simple Java API.  Shifu leverages Pig, Akka, Encog and other open source projects.

Behind the Name
----------------

In Mandarin, 师傅 (shifu) means master, teacher, or trainer.  We think it happens to be a perfect name for a machine learning and model training framework.
