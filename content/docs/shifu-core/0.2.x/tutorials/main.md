The following tutorials show how Shifu can be used to train and evaluate neural network models. 


Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer Tutorial
-------------------------------------------

This tutorial trains a model on the [Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) data set.  The models tries to predict a diagnosis of **Benign** or **Malignant**.

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

This tutorial illustrates the following Shifu functionality.

*  Computing [variable statistics](../../guide/stats)
*  Automated [variable selection](../../guide/varselect) based on KS ranking
*  Data set [variable normalization](../../guide/normalize) 
*  Distributed neural network [model training](../../guide/train) on Hadoop
*  Model [performance evaluation](../../guide/eval)
