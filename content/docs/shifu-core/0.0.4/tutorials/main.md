[Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer Tutorial](../wdbc)
---------

The Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer Turorial builds a model on a  data set containing features from digitized images.  This tutorial will train a model based on Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) data to tell whether the diagnosis is **Benign** or **Malignant**

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
